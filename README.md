Create an empty Repository on github.com, follow video, Do Not add a README or anything else, leave it empty. Name it whatever yo'd like.

now type...
cd (paste name of the new repository you just made)
npm install gh-pages --save-dev

Go to package.json line 27 and change homepage to yours. 
"http://<username>.github.io/<repository>"

run command...
git init

if it prompts questions, press enter through the end.

git remote add origin https://github.com/gitname/<repository>
git remote -v
npm run deploy

You should now have a 2nd branch in your Repo named gh-pages.

git add --all // git add .
git commit -m "<message/description>"
git push origin master

YOU'RE NOW LIVE!!! GRATS!!! Now go deploy on Mainnet, and switch out the Contract Address fields and network ID. That's it! Go buy a rng Twee the Bee NFT if this helped you!
